# News Aggregator
 This script collects news articles from predefined RSS feed URLs, stores them in a SQLite database to maintain a clean, duplicate-free collection, and provides the functionality to print article details to the console or export them to an Excel spreadsheet. It's a perfect example of how a small tool can significantly streamline the process of data aggregation and analysis.
